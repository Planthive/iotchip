### IoT Chip Packages

Eden IoT Chip Project is a large closed-source partially open source projectâ€”it's made up of over [100 repositories](https://gitlab.com/edensynth/iotchip).
When you initially consider contributing to Eden Synthetics IoT Chip Project, you might be unsure about which of those 100 repositories implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for.
This section should help you with that.

The main languages and technologies involved in this project are:

* Shell/Bash scripting
* C
* Python
* Javascript
* PHP
* HTML/CSS

Eden is intentionally very modular.
Nearly every element you interact with comes from a package or a class, even fundamental things like Microchip and the Webcam.
